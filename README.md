# ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch_in_Python
This is where I store the ML Algorithms I've implemented from scratch with numpy in Python.

In each folder, look at:
- `problems.md` for a report on some of my experiments and open response questions I've answered
- `src` for the code I wrote to implement the algorithm from scratch
- `tests` for the automated tests I had to pass as part of the EECS 349: Machine Learning course at Northwestern University.
